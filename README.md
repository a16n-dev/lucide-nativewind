# Lucide Icons for ReactNative with NativeWind
A drop in replacement for `lucide-react-native` to work with NativeWind. It provides [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/) with an additional `className` prop to allow for easy integration with [NativeWind](https://native-wind.js.org/).

## Installation
You can use either npm or yarn:

Using npm:

```bash
npm install lucide-nativewind
```
Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add lucide-nativewind
```
## Usage
`lucide-nativewind` is built with ES modules so it's completely tree-shakable. Each icon can be imported as a react component.


All icons can be imported the same as if using the `lucide-react-native` package
```jsx
import { ArrowLeftCircleIcon } from 'lucide-nativeWind';
```

## Versioning
The version is automatically kept in sync with `lucide-react-native`

## Contributing
All contributions welcome. Contributions/requests for new/updated icons should be directed to the lucide project: https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide

## FAQs

### What icons are available?
